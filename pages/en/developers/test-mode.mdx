Use Test Mode to simulate your development environment.

SimplifyTrip Test Mode lets you integrate your system without real charges or real payments.
It simulates real transactions without affecting live transactions or real cash flow.
We recommend using Test Mode for QA throughout development.

### Test Mode
In Test Mode, you can simulate transactions to ensure your integration works correctly.
This helps identify issues before going live with real transactions.

After creating a SimplifyTrip account, you can find a set of test API keys in the SimplifyTrip Dashboard.
Use these keys to create and retrieve simulated data through SimplifyTrip APIs.
To start real transactions, you need to **activate your account**, disable Test Mode, and use **Live API Keys**.

import { Callout, Table, Td, Th, Tr } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout>
  **Note** In the Dashboard, changing settings in Test Mode can also affect Live Mode settings. Some pages show a red warning and disable certain Live Mode settings while you are in Test Mode. If no red warning is shown, changes may affect Live Mode settings as well.
</Callout>

### Test Mode vs Live Mode

All SimplifyTrip API requests run in either Test Mode or Live Mode. Objects in one mode are not available in the other mode. For example, in Test Mode, wallets cannot make live payments.

<Table className='my-5'>
  <thead>
    <Tr>
      <Th>Mode</Th>
      <Th>Use case</Th>
      <Th>Objects</Th>
      <Th>How to use</Th>
    </Tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <Tr>
      <Td>Test Mode</Td>
      <Td>Use Test Mode and corresponding test API keys while building integration. In this mode, transactions, wallet balances, and product data are simulated.</Td>
      <Td>API calls return mock objects. For example, you can retrieve and use test eSIM and wallet objects.</Td>
      <Td>Use Test Mode wallets for testing. You cannot accept real payments or work with real wallets.</Td>
    </Tr>
    <Tr>
      <Td>Live Mode</Td>
      <Td>Use Live Mode and corresponding live API keys when you are ready to launch and accept real money. In this mode, all transactions are real and wallet balances are deducted for real.</Td>
      <Td>API calls return real objects. For example, you can retrieve and use real eSIM and wallet objects.</Td>
      <Td>Products returned by SimplifyTrip are live and can be delivered to your customers.</Td>
    </Tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

The **Test Mode** toggle in Dashboard does not change your integration code behavior directly. Your API keys determine behavior. The key you use for authentication decides whether the request is processed in Test Mode or Live Mode. Test API keys start with `pk_test_`, and live API keys start with `pk_live_`.
