# Frequently asked questions

Frequently asked questions when integrating SimplifyTrip Open APIs.

### 1. What is a signature and when should I use it?
- A signature is a string used to verify data integrity when data is exchanged between your system and SimplifyTrip. It is generated from `checksumKey` and the corresponding data fields required by each API.

- Every time you receive data from SimplifyTrip, you should verify the signature to ensure the payload is authentic and unchanged.

- Common use cases:
	- Creating an order
	- Receiving order data via webhook

### 2. Why do I get an invalid signature error?
- Check that your signature input fields are correct. First flatten the payload into a single-level object. Then sort fields alphabetically before generating the signature.

- Make sure your payload is sent in the request body and in JSON format.

See [Verify data with signature](/developers/signature).

### 3. How do I keep my SimplifyTrip API integration secure?
- **Protect API keys**: Never expose keys in public code. Store them in environment variables or secure config.
- **Authenticate users**: Ensure only authorized users can access your API integration.
- **Encrypt sensitive data**: Encrypt sensitive information before transmission.
