# Rate Limit
To protect APIs, the system enforces rate limits to avoid overload when one API is called too frequently in a short time.

If you send too many requests at once, the API returns HTTP `429` `Too Many Requests`.

You should manage API usage carefully to avoid exceeding limits and impacting service stability.

### API limiters
We apply multiple limiters, including request-rate limiter and concurrency limiter.

We may adjust limits to prevent abuse. If you need higher limits for high-traffic workloads, contact SimplifyTrip Support. For large limit increases, contact us at least 6 weeks in advance.

###### Rate limiter

A Request ID is a combination of `[IP Address]`, `[HTTP Method]`, `[Mode]`, and `[Api Key]`. Request counting is based on Request ID.

Rate limiting uses the Leaky Bucket algorithm with a 3-second window. Limits reset every 3 seconds.

Method limits:

      <Th align="center">Method</Th>
      <Th>Limit</Th>
    </Tr>

  <tbody>
    <Tr>
      <Td align="center">**GET**</Td>
      <Td>2000 requests / 3 seconds</Td>
    </Tr>
    <Tr>
      <Td align="center">**POST**</Td>
      <Td>100 requests / 3 seconds</Td>
    </Tr>
    <Tr>
      <Td align="center">**PUT**</Td>
      <Td>100 requests / 3 seconds</Td>
    </Tr>
    <Tr>
      <Td align="center">**DELETE**</Td>
      <Td>100 requests / 3 seconds</Td>
    </Tr>
    <Tr>
      <Td align="center">**Other**</Td>
      <Td>50 requests / 3 seconds</Td>
    </Tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

###### Concurrency limiter

Concurrency limiter restricts how many requests can be active at the same time. Concurrency-limit violations often indicate long-running or resource-intensive requests.

  **Note** This rate-limit mechanism does not apply to inter-service API calls inside SimplifyTrip internal systems.

### Common causes and mitigation

- Bursts of high-volume requests can trigger limits. Usually this happens during analytics or migration workloads. Control client-side request rate.

- Many long-lived requests can trigger concurrency limits. Endpoints with expensive operations may take longer. Monitor request durations and timeouts.

- Sudden traffic spikes (for example flash sales) can trigger limits. If you expect a spike, contact SimplifyTrip Support beforehand.

### Handling rate limits
- Detect HTTP `429` and implement retries with exponential backoff.

- Add jitter to backoff intervals to avoid thundering herd effects.

- Apply global traffic shaping on your side, not just per-request optimization.

- Implement client-side rate limiting that tracks request volume over time.

- Cache API responses where appropriate to reduce unnecessary calls.

### Load testing
Many teams run load tests using Test Mode. We generally do not recommend this as a direct proxy for production because Test Mode limits and behavior can differ from live environment.

A better approach is to build configurable mocks for SimplifyTrip API in your load-testing setup and simulate realistic latency profiles based on live measurements.
