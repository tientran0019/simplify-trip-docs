# Institution wallets

This section contains wallet information for your institution. Access it at <a href={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PARTNERS_URL + '/wallet'} className="underline" target='_blank'>Wallet management</a>.

There are two wallet types:

- **Top-up wallet:** Default wallet type for newly onboarded institutions. You must top up in advance before using services. Keep your wallet balance positive to avoid service interruption. When balance drops below the threshold, Owner receives an email reminder to top up. Each order deducts the corresponding amount from this wallet.

- **Credit wallet:** Available for eligible institutions. Contact SimplifyTrip for eligibility conditions. With a credit wallet, transactions can be made before top-up and charges are accumulated as debt. At month-end, SimplifyTrip issues a statement and sends debt notification to Owner. You have 10 days to settle debt; overdue debt may lock the wallet and interrupt services.

<Callout type="info">
 	You can choose either wallet type as your default payment wallet. SimplifyTrip deducts transaction amounts from the default wallet.
</Callout>

### Wallets in Test Mode

SimplifyTrip provides separate environments to support safe testing.

In Test Mode, all transactions are simulated, so wallets in this mode are virtual. Funds are for testing only; you can top up freely without real cost. Credit-wallet debt in Test Mode does not require real settlement.
