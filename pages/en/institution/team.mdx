# Manage institution members
An institution can have multiple members with different roles. To manage your members, go to <a href={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PARTNERS_URL + '/team'} className="underline" target='_blank'>Team management</a>.

<Callout>
 	Only users with `Owner` or `Administrator` role can perform the actions below.
</Callout>

## Add member

<Steps>
#### Start
Click `Add member` to begin.

<div className="my-5">
	<img src="/screenshots/team-add.png" width="100%" />
</div>

#### Enter information
Enter the email address of the member you want to add.

<Callout>
 	Make sure the email is correct. An invitation email is sent to that address.
</Callout>

If the invited member does not have a SimplifyTrip account, SimplifyTrip creates one automatically and includes login credentials in the invitation email.

#### Choose role
The member role can be changed later.

Available roles:

<Table className='my-5'>
  <thead>
    <Tr>
      <Th>Role</Th>
      <Th>Description</Th>
    </Tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <Tr>
      <Td>Administrator</Td>
      <Td>For users who need account-owner-like access. This role can view and manage almost everything.</Td>
    </Tr>
    <Tr>
      <Td>Developer</Td>
      <Td>For engineers setting up SimplifyTrip integrations. This role can access sensitive keys and most SimplifyTrip resources.</Td>
    </Tr>
    <Tr>
      <Td>Accountant</Td>
      <Td>For users handling debt payment, wallet top-up, wallet management, reporting, and data export.</Td>
    </Tr>
    <Tr>
      <Td>Viewer</Td>
      <Td>For read-only users who need to view payments, balances, linked accounts, reports, and exported data.</Td>
    </Tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

Owner has full permissions in the institution. Owner is a special administrator role that can perform all actions, including institution closure. The institution creator is assigned as Owner by default. Only Owner can assign the Owner role to other members.

#### Submit
SimplifyTrip sends an invitation email to the member. If they do not receive it, you can resend the invitation anytime.
</Steps>

## Remove member
Administrators can remove any member except members with the `Owner` role.
