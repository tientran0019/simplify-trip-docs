# Institution management

Any business model can register to use SimplifyTrip Open API: individuals, household businesses, companies, and more. In this documentation, they are all referred to as an **Institution**. There are two main types:

- Legal entities (with business registration code)
- Non-legal entities (individual business operators)

All institutions start in **Test Mode**. [Learn more about Test Mode in SimplifyTrip](/developers/test-mode)

SimplifyTrip must verify institution ownership to ensure registrations are valid before your application can move to **Live Mode**.
